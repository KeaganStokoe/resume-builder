# resume-builder

### Overview

A web application that auto-generates a properly formatted resume from the information filled up in a form.

### Key Ideas

- Build a React form by making modularized components using Material UI and React-Boostrap & calling these components in sequence to get required input data to generate resume.
- Process the information on the server(Node) and using some HTML to PDF libraries to generate the resume.
- Make it auto-download on client side.

## Run the application (WIP)

1. In the root folder, run `yarn` to install all dependencies. 
2. In the client folder, run `yarn` to install all dependencies. 
3. Run `yarn dev` to run the development instance
